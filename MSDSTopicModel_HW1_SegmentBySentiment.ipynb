Then it worked for another few days, after which it died. It does not display anything at all, let alone keeping time!Since then we have been trying to get this thing repaired, but without any success!!Pure junk in the name of Nike!!

            "[\"I'm on my 4th watch... I keep returning it due to poor design.  The band keeps coming apart in the same spot!  Nike hasn't been helpful when I've been in contact with them.  Now, I'm on my 4th watch and something funking is going on with the face of this watch and I've brought it in to a jeweler to have the battery changed.. TWICE and it's still acting up.  I wouldn't purchase another NIKE watch.\", \"i had some problems with this order, the bill didn't arrive with the watch to the p.o. box and it couldn't be sent to my country as it was supossed to, when i finally recieved this watch (after sending several emails to solve the situation) it just didn't work, i had to spent money to fix it.\", \"Watch was very small and barely fit my 6 year-old daughter's wrist.  And she has a small frame!  Strange.\", \"The digital numbers were impossible to see I don't know if there was something wrong with the watch but the glare was terrible.  I sent this watch back.\", 'Everything that glitters is not gold!Similarly everything that has Nike written on it is not good!!I bought this item from Amazon for a friend in early 2004. That poor guy had used it for hardly few weeks when the display of it dimmed. So thinking that its a battery issue he replaced tha battery from an authorised shop. Then it worked for another few days, after which it died. It does not display anything at all, let alone keeping time!Since then we have been trying to get this thing repaired, but without any success!!Pure junk in the name of Nike!! Would not recommend any watch of Nike to anyone, you better get a Timex, it may not have \"just do it\" on it but it would at least keep the time!! :)', \"I received these shoes last week. Aside from the usual break in period (stiffness), these shoes didn't take long to soften up.  My heels usually take a beating when I walk the golf course.  After my first round of golf wearing these shoes, my heels felt fine and no pain in the usual areas.\", \"My husband liked the colors of these shoes, but the width was wrong. Did not have this shoe in a 7 wide, so I ordered him a B width. He said they hurt his feet. Took them to a shoe repair shop and had them stretched twice. Didn't help. Giving them to the Goodwill. It was too late to have them sent back.\", 'Shoes do not fit like traditional Nike golf shoes... almost felt defective.  Ended up giving them away because they were so uncomfortable the first time I wore them on the field.  Would not recommend.', \"They are confortable to wear and are of quality construction. They haven't helped my golf game though! I guess shoes aren't my problem!\", 'These shoes were very stiff when I first got them but they broke in quickly.Good pair to play in.', 'Sent wrong color shoes. Sent white when I ordered black but I had to use them anyway because of time. Not very happy. Shoes are good quality though', 'I knew the second I took them out of the box that they were too narrow, and looked a bit too short as well ( I wear a 14).  Once I tried them on (with dress socks) and struggled mightily, I knew golf socks would not work, and they were simply too small in every way to play.  I would plan on them being this way for you as well and either order a bigger size and width, or get another shoe.', 'I had to return the shoes after wearing them just two times, because they did not live up to the water proof waranty.', \"I have owned this Nike watch for 7 months. Don't waste your money.  The black bubber wrist band had separated from the body at the rear battery cover. The entire rubber/plastic hinge had cracked. This wrist band is not replaceable. A sports watch should be made rugged. This one is not. Lesson learned is to buy a watch which has a standard replacable wrist band.\", 'Too tight which makr it uncomfortable, I think the size may not be accurate. Esthetically it is not bad. But it fit weirdly in my feet', 'This shoe is a nice looking shoe. It just runs small. Money wasted. No more buying shoes online for me.', \"The size was not right, but I would have returned them anyway as they arrived laced up, with sock fuzz in side, and soles a bit dirty...one had a small pc of gravel imbedded.  Gross.  I got someone's returned, slightly used shoes.Merry Xmas?  Ugh....\", 'I bought a Size 11 (D) from Dicks and it was too narrow for my feet. I had to return it back. If you have wide feet, make sure you dont order these as they come very narrow.', 'I ordered a half size larger than I wear in a dress show and I am not sure this large enough, had not had time to wear around the house to try out as I got them just before leaving on a trip where I wanted to wear them, but on first trying them out of the box I felt they were too small. I will try again before deciding to keep or return', 'This shoe is inaccurately sized at 11 1/2 - too small. I should have returned them, but thought they would have stretched. They did, but not enough. Wearable, but not quite right. Have bought dozens of running shoes at 11 1/2 size (I wear an 11 street shoe) and this one is way on the left end of the bell curve of fits.']\n"
